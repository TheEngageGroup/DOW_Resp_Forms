# DOW_Resp_Forms
Documentation on how to replicate the new 2014 DOW action and donation forms
##Action Alerts
1. There are two example action alerts that can be duplicated for production (2015 Wolf and 2015 Polar Bear).
2. The Action Alert redirects to Thank You Pagebuilder pages upon completion (2015_Alert_Thank_You_Wolf and 2015_Alert_Thank_You_Polar_Bear). 
3. Both the action alerts and the pagebuilder thank you pages use the same page wrapper (2015 Action & TY Wolf and 2015 Action & TY Polar Bear).
4. If you want to create a new version (e.g. new animal banner), you must duplicate the page wrapper and replace the banner image in two places.
